# simple image manipulation
- This is a very small class that can do some useful image manipulations.
- This class was intended to be add to my [gfx-project](https://github.com/Mostafa-Khab/gfx-project.git)
- Because I found it useful so I decided that it will have its own repo.

### what can you do?
- basic manipulations like crop, color mask, overlay, creating plain ones, etc...

### how to use.
- you need to download stb_image.h and stb_image_write.h from [https://github.com/nothings/stb.git](https://github.com/nothings/stb.git).
- logger can be found in deps in [gfx-project](https://github.com/Mostafa-Khab/gfx-project.git), 

### NOTE:
This small project was made for learning purposes, so don't overrate it :smile:.

### NEW:
You can now create an image from a string (or even wstring) and a font file.
